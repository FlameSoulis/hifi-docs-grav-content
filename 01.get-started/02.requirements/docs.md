High Fidelity has been designed to be an immersive and interactive experience. Learn if your system meets all the requirements to run Interface and Sandbox. 



##System Requirements

The system requirements are listed below. 

|             | Graphics Card                            | Processor                           | RAM  | OS                            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---- | ----------------------------- |
| **Windows** | NVIDIA GTX 970 / AMD R9 290 equiv. or greater | Intel i5-4590 equivalent or greater | 8GB+ | Windows 7 SP1 64 bit or newer |
| **OS X**    | NVIDIA GTX 970 / AMD R9 290 equiv. or greater | Intel i5-4590 equivalent or greater | 8GB+ | Mountain Lion (10.8) or newer |
| **Linux**   |                                          | Intel i5-4590 equivalent or greater | 8GB+ |                               |





##Additional Hardware Requirements

While a lot of High Fidelity’s features are available with a desktop, for the best experience, we recommend using VR hardware such as head mounted displays (HMD), hand controllers and audio headsets.  HMDs are display devices that allow the user to view virtual reality. Hand controllers will help you navigate and create in-world. Finally, High Fidelity delivers all audio over UDP in an uncompressed 16-bit, 24Khz format, and spatializes audio in real-time based on the location of the listener and the sound sources. A good headset will enhance your experience. 

We’ve listed the hardware requirements below. 

>>>>>Ensure that your system meets the requirements for whichever additional hardware equipment you choose to use.
