*Learn how you can get your initial grant of HFC to start shopping in High Fidelity.*

## Introduction

High Fidelity Commerce is in open Beta. This means when you first log in to High Fidelity, you will not have any HFC available to start shopping. 

 Want more HFC? Get it by going to [Bank Of High Fidelity](https://hifi.place/BankOfHighFidelity) and meeting with the banker!
